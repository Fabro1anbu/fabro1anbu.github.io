                    <p>As I said we just need to start the desired thing by start doing it, there is no secret mantra for this but I can tell you are the one who needs to take one hundred percent responsibility for your desire thing. let me tell you one interesting example for you. </p>

                    <p>Take me as an example instinctively one idea popped up in my head that drives me to create a blog page like this which you have reading right now.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How i started this Blog Page</h3>
                    
                    <blockquote>An average person has over 6,000 thoughts per day, according to a study that isolated a 'thought worm' in the human brain showing when an idea begins and ends. </blockquote>

                    <p>where will these thoughts get saved?  it is in our brain but the ultimate question was not that the million-dollar question was how we can remember these thoughts? by only recalling them so I created this blog page to get full usage of my thoughts. </p>

                    <p>The interesting point I need to make here if creating a blog page was my thought and I am not doing it then it doesn't exist right now.  So what I did to start my first blog page as I said earlier, there is no secret behind this I just start doing it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Starting point</h2>

                    <p>the toughest part of every journey was the starting point. to surpass that level we need to motivate ourselves to do that. No one will come behind us and tell us to go and get it. we need to take the first initiative to achieve our desire goal the whole responsibilities belong to us. </p>

                    <p>No matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>once we get going nothing can stop us unless we decided to stop at a certain point lol ! ! just kidding why do we need to stop when all things were working fine. Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
