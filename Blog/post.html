                    <p>As I said we just need to start the desired thing by start doing it, there is no secret mantra for this but I can tell you are the one who needs to take one hundred percent responsibility for your desire thing. let me tell you one interesting example for you. </p>

                    <p>Take me as an example instinctively one idea popped up in my head that drives me to create a blog page like this which you have reading right now.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How i started this Blog Page</h3>
                    
                    <blockquote>An average person has over 6,000 thoughts per day, according to a study that isolated a 'thought worm' in the human brain showing when an idea begins and ends. </blockquote>

                    <p>where will these thoughts get saved?  it is in our brain but the ultimate question was not that the million-dollar question was how we can remember these thoughts? by only recalling them so I created this blog page to get full usage of my thoughts. </p>

                    <p>The interesting point I need to make here if creating a blog page was my thought and I am not doing it then it doesn't exist right now.  So what I did to start my first blog page as I said earlier, there is no secret behind this I just start doing it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Starting point</h2>

                    <p>the toughest part of every journey was the starting point. to surpass that level we need to motivate ourselves to do that. No one will come behind us and tell us to go and get it. we need to take the first initiative to achieve our desire goal the whole responsibilities belong to us. </p>

                    <p>No matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>once we get going nothing can stop us unless we decided to stop at a certain point lol ! ! just kidding why do we need to stop when all things were working fine. Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>Firstly you need to understand that learning and studying are not the same. Both are two different things but people always mess up with these two things and get lost somewhere. Before delving into this concept let me tell you the key difference between the two things, let's get started. </p>

                    <h3>Study vs Learn</h3>

                    <p>When you are reading something and memorizing it, this process of action is said to be studying you have familiar with this word when you were at school. </p>

                    <p>Let me take you to our school days. Back in our school days to learn something we used to study something that means we used to memorize something and we wrote exams that's why some students have forgotten those content which they had written in their exams after some months.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/forget.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>However, learning is not about studying, it's all about how you understanding the concept and implementing the concept. 
                        That's why it is impossible to study mathematics unless you were taking some sort of efforts to solve problems 
                        When you are making some efforts to implement something, instinctively this part of the process comes under the learning phase
                        I hope you got some ideas about learning and studying.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How we can use studying to accelerate learning?</h2>

                    <p>As for as you understand, you know how important to learn something rather than memorizing it. But studying also involve in the learning process not that much what I meant was if we are learning something the first process of learning was reading aka studying, once we get a clear view about these two things then we can easily identify two things. </p>

                    <p>Some people have the innate talent to learn something faster but I don't believe such things. If you need to learn something fast you need to have relentless hard work and smart enough to do implementing consistently.</p>

                     <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dontforget.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">An elephant never forgets</span>

                    <p>Consistent is a key here where you can progress little by doing the same thing again and again. This may cost you huge impact in your life if you are consistent enough to do it for five years from now on. It will give you a bigger impact on your life.</p>

    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>The harsh reality is Google is far better than teachers. 
                        A good example is that you can't ask a geography question to a science teacher like you can't ask a science question to
                         a geography teacher.  Because they don't know about that however Google is not like your teacher in your school and 
                         college.  It will return the appropriate answer for your appropriate question. That's how our technology has evolved 
                         right now </p>

                    <h3>Our society right now</h3>

                    <p>We are living in a community where we don't need any college degree to get a job. In reality, we don't need any job to earn money. There are several ways to earn money online without going to work. This is a separate topic we are not going to talk about in this blog right now.  </p>
                        <h4>Let's focus on why teachers are unable to answer questions that are not related to them? </h4>

                        <p>The strange reality is they don't know. Yes indeed really they don't know how to answer because they came from an environment where they used to learn about a particular subject and they mastered it but apart from that particular subject they don't know anything. That's the reason why teachers failed to answer non-related subject questions.</p>
           
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/doubt.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>In school days if you were puzzled with non-related subject questions you unable to ask that to anyone.
                         It will remain unsolved problems forever. These puzzling questions should have answered properly.
                          Your teachers will not answer those complicated questions Which were not related to the subject.
                         They merely focus on a subject that was allocated to them according to the syllabus. </p>
                         <p>So where can we find these answers to puzzled and complicated questions? This is why Google comes into the picture in our life. We can ask Google anything without fear.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> How did I find out the answer to puzzling question?</h2>

                    <p>One night I had a strange dream. I woke up in the middle of the dream itself. I was astonished at that time. One of my horrible nights in recent times, the next morning I did a Google search on dreams and  I found out all the answers to unsolved questions Which were crawling inside my head. </p>

                    <p>I am gonna show you how I did and how I found my appropriate answer.
                        </p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dream.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">On that Morning after I getting up what I searched was this</span>

                    <p>The question might be silly however, I need some answers based on a silly question of mine.

                        I finally found some Google searches which were related to my questions and I ended up with the desired answer which was crawling inside my head for quite a long period. That was amazing, wasn't it?? </p>
                        <p>As a self-taught programmer, I do a lot of Google searches a day.  I highly recommended you to use Google search more often because it will enhance your searching skills as well. It's good to have such skill in your pocket so that you'll get answers to perplexing questions much faster rather than depending on your teacher.</p>

                    <p>Skills are inevitable in this decade. If you are reading this right now then you are performing a skill that helps you to read.
                         So skills are everywhere in your daily life which you might not notice. However, these skills would let you achieve your desired goals. 
                         Every human being has skills but what kind of skills they have that matters the most. </p>

                         <p>If you are doing the same thing again and again then it would become automated,
                              what I meant was if you mastered something then you would do that without thinking, 
                              for instance, brushing your teeth, you have been doing this since childhood so it became automated to you. 
                              Just like that, you could perform any skills without thinking inside your brain.</p>

                    <h3>How can we master certain skill?</h3>

                    <p> To master a particular skill, you just need to practice.
                         I bet you at the initial stages for sure, 
                         you will face some sort of struggles but you need to learn from those mistakes and keep on working on them. 
                         One day you will find a better way to overcome those hurdles. 
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/hand.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Eventually, those mistakes will become your experience. That's how you would gain experience from your losses. The most important thing here is that you should not give up under any circumstances. Obstacles and impediments are the pathways to mastering a skill.</p>
                        
                    
                    <h3>Do’s and don'ts while mastering a skill.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One skill at a time, don't ever try to focus on two or more skills at a time then you would end up with strange results. </li>
                        <li>Because your brain cannot handle such a situation.</li>
                        <li>You need patience, you cannot master a skill within a night, it takes time.</li>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/do.png" alt="">
                        <li>Small progress a day will help you to achieve something enormous, Rather than doing nothing a day.</li>
                        <blockquote>A simple calculation where I learned from a book atomic habits, 0.1 effort per day for one year that is 0.1 * 365 = 36.5 on the other hand zero effort a day for one year this means nothing.</blockquote>
                        <li>What I am trying to explain to you that rather than spending a day without zero efforts you could spend at least 0.1 effort a day</li>
                        <li>Once you master a skill then you could add another skill in your hub.</li>

                      </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Eliminate Bad Skills</h2>
                        <p>If there is a hero then there will be a villain too. Keep this in your mind to achieve your goals. The first and foremost thing you need to do is put an end to bad skills because that won't help you in the long run. Don't let yourself get bogged down in doing bad skills. </p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cancel.png" alt="">

                    <p>At the initial stages, bad skills may feel good however they will destroy your dream and ruin your career. So I request you to declutter the skills which are not useful to your career. Hone your good skills as much as you can so that at a later stage you will be proud of yourself.
                    </p>

                   <p>To be very honest, celebrating a birthday was Christian culture. In Christianity, it is believed that all people are born with original sin. This is the kind of pattern people were following for more than decades. Nowadays technology has grown at its peak. We have all the information at our finger point but what we are doing with these technologies. </p>
                   <blockquote>According to a study, there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide - that is
                    60 percent of the global population,

                    <h2> Why do we stay on social media platforms all day all time?</h2>

                   <p>People were surfing on social media. Because this was a pattern we developed in recent times. But some people are aware of these things and stay away from these things and Now they are in a higher position in their respective fields. 
                    So what were we doing? We were just following one kind of pattern which was developed by someone else who doesn't exist right now. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <h2>Why do we follow those patterns in our life?
                    </h2>
                    <p>As I said we were following some kind of rules in our daily life. Starting right from our schooling to going to the job right now. Some people won't follow this kind of rules and patterns which were created by a human so they were at the top of their respective field.From a young age, we were triggered to follow these kinds of restrictions  by our parents, priests, teachers, and the list goes on.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to get rid of this kind of curtailment? </h2>

                 <p>As simple as that, we should not follow these rules. That's it.When you have enough knowledge about this world then you'll come to know that these patterns were counterfeit. The more you learn the better you'll become. When I was studying at school my teacher used to say ''we don't need to study after higher studies just we need to Go to college where no one will come to us and say study'' so I thought once our school days are done then we don't need to study anymore. But learning doesn't work like this. We need to learn until we die. Learning plays a huge role in the human life cycle.

                    <p>I believe you have probably heard about the side hustle. If not then I will explain to you no worries. A side hustle is nothing but doing a small business or work, Which is not related to an authentic job of yours. More importantly, it will also give extra money like your permanent job which you might not expect, however, It really makes you busy all the time, that is what you need at a young age. </p>

        <h3>How To Pick A Right Side Hustle For You?</h3>

                  <p>Now you know something about side hustle but you don't have any idea about how to select appropriate side hustle for you.
                       Here I am going to share some examples that help you to find your appropriate side hustle. </p>
                       <p>So let's delve in. If you have already chosen your passion then it will be very easy to choose but if not find one then work on it. If you don't have any skills no issues you can learn your desired skills online. </p>
                    
                       <ul>Websites like

                        </li>
        
                        <li> <a href=" https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">coursera</a>  </li>

                    <p>This is the exact way to start a side hustle. Never try to focus on money at the initial stage. The first and foremost thing here is experience, experience matters here. If you gain experience then money comes automatically without knocking on the door.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Take Advantage Of Side Hustle </h3>

    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                   <p>It may sound crazy but in order to achieve something big then you have to keep yourself busy at any cost. It's not like watching Netflix all the time. Be productive. So today I am gonna tell you seven ways to keep you more productive to achieve your desired goal.</p>
                    
                   <h3> <li> Set A Goal And Work On It.
                   </li></h3>

                   <p>In order to achieve something big, you need to set an appropriate goal for yourself. People who don’t have goals are wasting their lives. There is no point in living in this cruel world without setting a goal. Think about football if there is no goal post then what would happen? It sounds strange, It's really like wasting precious time with no goal. Setting a goal is one of the most important aspects of our life. We should not neglect those things.</p>
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="img/goals.jpg" alt="">
                   <p>On the other hand, if you have already set your goals then you must break those goals into two, long-term and short-term goals respectively then focus on short-term goals then you will get closer to a long-term goal.</p>

                   <h3> <li> Do Exercise
                </li></h3>

                   <p>If you are working for a certain goal then you need to be fit. Keeping your body fit will help you in the long run. Look if you need to achieve something big then initially you have to work for almost 12 to 15 hours a day, for that you need energy so doing exercise will possess an energy that helps you to work more than 10 to 12 hours a day. </p>
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="img/exercise.jpg" alt="">
                   <p>If you are doing exercise in the morning then you can start the day on a positive note and it will keep you active in every department moreover it helps you to achieve your desired goals. So try to find an hour a day to exercise to keep you active at any cost.
                </p>

                <h3> <li> Reading
                </li></h3>

                 <p>Reading is all about gaining knowledge and wisdom. I would say reading a book is the most important thing in our life. Everyone sees this world from their perspective so if you are reading someone’s book then you would see this world from the author's perspective and what they experienced from this world. You can gain enormous wisdom which you didn't have earlier. </p>

                 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/read.jpg" alt="">

                 <p>It will help you to solve problems in your life as well and you can make the right decision at the right time. If you are stuck at something in your life at the same time you’re reading a book regarding life then for sure you can tackle those problems with the right mindset. Reading is a good habit which you can have in your bucket.
                </p>

                <h3> <li> Learn High-Income Skills
                </li></h3>

                <p>For living a successful life money matters here, in order to live a financially free life you should have money in your pocket to spend. Here is where supply and demand kick in.  In the olden days we used to trade goods instead of bucks however now things have been changed a lot. The business has evolved too. People now are looking for skilled people who can solve their much-complicated business problems.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/high-income-skills.png" alt="">
                <p>So you can learn any high-income skill like programming, digital marketing, Copywriting, Business Writing, Technical Writing, and the list goes on. Choose which suits you and learn it, you don't need to have prior experience and you can learn it either online or offline it's up to you. I highly recommend you to learn online because of the pandemic situation right now.

                  <p>I personally believe getting things done for people was the toughest job they are going to ever face. Getting our required things done is not a simple task, it does take a lot more effort from our side however most people fail to do so. Today let me brief you about stop procrastinating and get the desired job done at your earliest convenience so let’s delve into it.</p>
                
                  <ul>
                <b>These are the seven ways </b>

                    </li>
    
                    <li> <a href="#point5" >One at a time</a>  </li>

                    <li><a href="#point6" >Do it Day In, Day Out</a>  </li>

                    <li><a href="#point7" >Make to-do list</a>  </li>
                   
                </ul>

                    <h2>Break Into Chunks</h2>

                   <p>Most numbers of people lose motivation because of the end goals. They feel like the end goal will be a great task for them and then procrastinate those things and they will end up giving up because of the huge task they need to possess. Indeed, our end goal going to be large and enormous I agree with that however how we handle those things that matter the most. Declutter those tasks into small chunks then work on those small chunks, if you are able to concentrate on a small part of the end goal then you can easily complete those things quite easily.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Work Smarter Rather Than Working Hard</h2>
                      <p>People nowadays inspired by some motivational video based on their goals. Do some crazy stuff for 2 weeks straight then they get rid of those things because of the time and work they invested in for the initial stages. It may sound like crazy but this is what people do if they are working without any short-term goals and achievements, Then you cannot march past towards your destination.  Working smart is all about working on short-term goals which inevitably give you rewards that will make you move forward to achieve another short term-goal in your list. This kind of strategy will definitely help you to accomplish your desired goal.
                    </p>

                    <a href="#" id="point3"> </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reward Yourself</h2>
                     <p>Doing something without gaining any sort of rewards really hurts and make sure you get appropriate rewards based on your efforts. This kind of thing sounds insane but it’s really effective it will give a dopamine pump that gives the motivation to do another task that was related to your goal. No matter what you have done you should reward yourself to get motivated. Rewards could be anything you can like that does not matter here, what really matters is rewards so don’t ever forget to reward yourself for your small achievements you are going to make in your life.</p>

                     <h2 class="section-heading">Do not get distracted by something</h2>
                    <p>If you are distracted by something while doing then it’s really hard to get back to that thing really quick. So most people procrastinate because of this reason, I believe this is one of the main reasons why people procrastinate on certain things. Most people get distracted by the phone and some other electronic devices. There are some tricks you may follow to get rid of distractions.</p>

                     <img class="img-responsive" src="img/focus.jpeg" alt="">

                     <p>This might be hard to follow however it is effective when it comes to focusing on certain things. If you should not get distracted by gadgets then stay away from them while doing your task it will help you to focus on certain things for a longer period. Once in a while do yoga to get focus probably these things will you help you to accomplish your goals.

                    <a href="#" id="point5"> </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">One at a Time</h2>
                    <p>Doing multiple tasks at a time will end up hating those tasks. Let me tell you the reason behind that, the thing is you get motivated enough because you were doing multiple things at a time your brain will get confused and it will not focus on two or more work at a time. So while doing work make sure that you are doing one at a time, this kind of strategy will help you out to complete a certain task in a lower time because you were concentrating on a single task at a time so it will take just a few moments to finish and also you will get motivated quite often so that is enough to achieve your goal.
                    </p>

                    <a href="#" id="point6"> </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Do it Day In, Day Out</h2>
                  <p>Consistency is the key here, If you are being able to adapt your task as a habit then it would become hard to avoid only when you doing it on daily basis. This may seem hard but the truth is it’s hard but merely in the initial stages once you get the grip of that phase then you will find it easier. So it will take you to small progress day by day, small progress a day will give you a huge impact on years go by. You need to stay confident and be consistent to stop procrastinate certain things.</p>

                    <a href="#" id="point7"> </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Make To-Do List</h2>
                 <p>You need to be prepared enough to do certain things at certain timings for this you can achieve this by making a to-do list, It will come in handy because you have a plan for a full day now. So it stops you from doing a task at the wrong time and along with that, you can plan accordingly to fix a schedule for the future as well. </p> 
                 
                 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/todolist.png" alt="">

                 <p>Successful people would have a to-do list for five years, they will work accordingly that is why they were successful. So if you need to be successful you should have a to-do list in your pocket.
