                    <p>As I said we just need to start the desired thing by start doing it, there is no secret mantra for this but I can tell you are the one who needs to take one hundred percent responsibility for your desire thing. let me tell you one interesting example for you. </p>

                    <p>Take me as an example instinctively one idea popped up in my head that drives me to create a blog page like this which you have reading right now.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How i started this Blog Page</h3>
                    
                    <blockquote>An average person has over 6,000 thoughts per day, according to a study that isolated a 'thought worm' in the human brain showing when an idea begins and ends. </blockquote>

                    <p>where will these thoughts get saved?  it is in our brain but the ultimate question was not that the million-dollar question was how we can remember these thoughts? by only recalling them so I created this blog page to get full usage of my thoughts. </p>

                    <p>The interesting point I need to make here if creating a blog page was my thought and I am not doing it then it doesn't exist right now.  So what I did to start my first blog page as I said earlier, there is no secret behind this I just start doing it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Starting point</h2>

                    <p>the toughest part of every journey was the starting point. to surpass that level we need to motivate ourselves to do that. No one will come behind us and tell us to go and get it. we need to take the first initiative to achieve our desire goal the whole responsibilities belong to us. </p>

                    <p>No matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>once we get going nothing can stop us unless we decided to stop at a certain point lol ! ! just kidding why do we need to stop when all things were working fine. Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>Firstly you need to understand that learning and studying are not the same. Both are two different things but people always mess up with these two things and get lost somewhere. Before delving into this concept let me tell you the key difference between the two things, let's get started. </p>

                    <h3>Study vs Learn</h3>

                    <p>When you are reading something and memorizing it, this process of action is said to be studying you have familiar with this word when you were at school. </p>

                    <p>Let me take you to our school days. Back in our school days to learn something we used to study something that means we used to memorize something and we wrote exams that's why some students have forgotten those content which they had written in their exams after some months.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/forget.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>However, learning is not about studying, it's all about how you understanding the concept and implementing the concept. 
                        That's why it is impossible to study mathematics unless you were taking some sort of efforts to solve problems 
                        When you are making some efforts to implement something, instinctively this part of the process comes under the learning phase
                        I hope you got some ideas about learning and studying.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How we can use studying to accelerate learning?</h2>

                    <p>As for as you understand, you know how important to learn something rather than memorizing it. But studying also involve in the learning process not that much what I meant was if we are learning something the first process of learning was reading aka studying, once we get a clear view about these two things then we can easily identify two things. </p>

                    <p>Some people have the innate talent to learn something faster but I don't believe such things. If you need to learn something fast you need to have relentless hard work and smart enough to do implementing consistently.</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dontforget.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">An elephant never forgets</span>

                    <p>Consistent is a key here where you can progress little by doing the same thing again and again. This may cost you huge impact in your life if you are consistent enough to do it for five years from now on. It will give you a bigger impact on your life.</p>
