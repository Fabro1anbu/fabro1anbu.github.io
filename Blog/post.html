                    <p>As I said we just need to start the desired thing by start doing it, there is no secret mantra for this but I can tell you are the one who needs to take one hundred percent responsibility for your desire thing. let me tell you one interesting example for you. </p>

                    <p>Take me as an example instinctively one idea popped up in my head that drives me to create a blog page like this which you have reading right now.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How i started this Blog Page</h3>
                    
                    <blockquote>An average person has over 6,000 thoughts per day, according to a study that isolated a 'thought worm' in the human brain showing when an idea begins and ends. </blockquote>

                    <p>where will these thoughts get saved?  it is in our brain but the ultimate question was not that the million-dollar question was how we can remember these thoughts? by only recalling them so I created this blog page to get full usage of my thoughts. </p>

                    <p>The interesting point I need to make here if creating a blog page was my thought and I am not doing it then it doesn't exist right now.  So what I did to start my first blog page as I said earlier, there is no secret behind this I just start doing it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Starting point</h2>

                    <p>the toughest part of every journey was the starting point. to surpass that level we need to motivate ourselves to do that. No one will come behind us and tell us to go and get it. we need to take the first initiative to achieve our desire goal the whole responsibilities belong to us. </p>

                    <p>No matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>once we get going nothing can stop us unless we decided to stop at a certain point lol ! ! just kidding why do we need to stop when all things were working fine. Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>Firstly you need to understand that learning and studying are not the same. Both are two different things but people always mess up with these two things and get lost somewhere. Before delving into this concept let me tell you the key difference between the two things, let's get started. </p>

                    <h3>Study vs Learn</h3>

                    <p>When you are reading something and memorizing it, this process of action is said to be studying you have familiar with this word when you were at school. </p>

                    <p>Let me take you to our school days. Back in our school days to learn something we used to study something that means we used to memorize something and we wrote exams that's why some students have forgotten those content which they had written in their exams after some months.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/forget.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>However, learning is not about studying, it's all about how you understanding the concept and implementing the concept. 
                        That's why it is impossible to study mathematics unless you were taking some sort of efforts to solve problems 
                        When you are making some efforts to implement something, instinctively this part of the process comes under the learning phase
                        I hope you got some ideas about learning and studying.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How we can use studying to accelerate learning?</h2>

                    <p>As for as you understand, you know how important to learn something rather than memorizing it. But studying also involve in the learning process not that much what I meant was if we are learning something the first process of learning was reading aka studying, once we get a clear view about these two things then we can easily identify two things. </p>

                    <p>Some people have the innate talent to learn something faster but I don't believe such things. If you need to learn something fast you need to have relentless hard work and smart enough to do implementing consistently.</p>

                     <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dontforget.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">An elephant never forgets</span>

                    <p>Consistent is a key here where you can progress little by doing the same thing again and again. This may cost you huge impact in your life if you are consistent enough to do it for five years from now on. It will give you a bigger impact on your life.</p>

    <article>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>The harsh reality is Google is far better than teachers. 
                        A good example is that you can't ask a geography question to a science teacher like you can't ask a science question to
                         a geography teacher.  Because they don't know about that however Google is not like your teacher in your school and 
                         college.  It will return the appropriate answer for your appropriate question. That's how our technology has evolved 
                         right now </p>

                    <h3>Our society right now</h3>

                    <p>We are living in a community where we don't need any college degree to get a job. In reality, we don't need any job to earn money. There are several ways to earn money online without going to work. This is a separate topic we are not going to talk about in this blog right now.  </p>
                        <h4>Let's focus on why teachers are unable to answer questions that are not related to them? </h4>

                        <p>The strange reality is they don't know. Yes indeed really they don't know how to answer because they came from an environment where they used to learn about a particular subject and they mastered it but apart from that particular subject they don't know anything. That's the reason why teachers failed to answer non-related subject questions.</p>
           
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/doubt.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>In school days if you were puzzled with non-related subject questions you unable to ask that to anyone.
                         It will remain unsolved problems forever. These puzzling questions should have answered properly.
                          Your teachers will not answer those complicated questions Which were not related to the subject.
                         They merely focus on a subject that was allocated to them according to the syllabus. </p>
                         <p>So where can we find these answers to puzzled and complicated questions? This is why Google comes into the picture in our life. We can ask Google anything without fear.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> How did I find out the answer to puzzling question?</h2>

                    <p>One night I had a strange dream. I woke up in the middle of the dream itself. I was astonished at that time. One of my horrible nights in recent times, the next morning I did a Google search on dreams and  I found out all the answers to unsolved questions Which were crawling inside my head. </p>

                    <p>I am gonna show you how I did and how I found my appropriate answer.
                        </p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dream.JPG" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">On that Morning after I getting up what I searched was this</span>

                    <p>The question might be silly however, I need some answers based on a silly question of mine.

                        I finally found some Google searches which were related to my questions and I ended up with the desired answer which was crawling inside my head for quite a long period. That was amazing, wasn't it?? </p>
                        <p>As a self-taught programmer, I do a lot of Google searches a day.  I highly recommended you to use Google search more often because it will enhance your searching skills as well. It's good to have such skill in your pocket so that you'll get answers to perplexing questions much faster rather than depending on your teacher.</p>

                    <p>Skills are inevitable in this decade. If you are reading this right now then you are performing a skill that helps you to read.
                         So skills are everywhere in your daily life which you might not notice. However, these skills would let you achieve your desired goals. 
                         Every human being has skills but what kind of skills they have that matters the most. </p>

                         <p>If you are doing the same thing again and again then it would become automated,
                              what I meant was if you mastered something then you would do that without thinking, 
                              for instance, brushing your teeth, you have been doing this since childhood so it became automated to you. 
                              Just like that, you could perform any skills without thinking inside your brain.</p>

                    <h3>How can we master certain skill?</h3>

                    <p> To master a particular skill, you just need to practice.
                         I bet you at the initial stages for sure, 
                         you will face some sort of struggles but you need to learn from those mistakes and keep on working on them. 
                         One day you will find a better way to overcome those hurdles. 
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/hand.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Eventually, those mistakes will become your experience. That's how you would gain experience from your losses. The most important thing here is that you should not give up under any circumstances. Obstacles and impediments are the pathways to mastering a skill.</p>
                        
                    
                    <h3>Do’s and don'ts while mastering a skill.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One skill at a time, don't ever try to focus on two or more skills at a time then you would end up with strange results. </li>
                        <li>Because your brain cannot handle such a situation.</li>
                        <li>You need patience, you cannot master a skill within a night, it takes time.</li>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/do.png" alt="">
                        <li>Small progress a day will help you to achieve something enormous, Rather than doing nothing a day.</li>
                        <blockquote>A simple calculation where I learned from a book atomic habits, 0.1 effort per day for one year that is 0.1 * 365 = 36.5 on the other hand zero effort a day for one year this means nothing.</blockquote>
                        <li>What I am trying to explain to you that rather than spending a day without zero efforts you could spend at least 0.1 effort a day</li>
                        <li>Once you master a skill then you could add another skill in your hub.</li>

                      </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Eliminate Bad Skills</h2>
                        <p>If there is a hero then there will be a villain too. Keep this in your mind to achieve your goals. The first and foremost thing you need to do is put an end to bad skills because that won't help you in the long run. Don't let yourself get bogged down in doing bad skills. </p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cancel.png" alt="">

                    <p>At the initial stages, bad skills may feel good however they will destroy your dream and ruin your career. So I request you to declutter the skills which are not useful to your career. Hone your good skills as much as you can so that at a later stage you will be proud of yourself.

                   <p>To be very honest, celebrating a birthday was Christian culture. In Christianity, it is believed that all people are born with original sin. This is the kind of pattern people were following for more than decades. Nowadays technology has grown at its peak. We have all the information at our finger point but what we are doing with these technologies. </p>

                    <h2> Why do we stay on social media platforms all day all time?</h2>

                   <p>People were surfing on social media. Because this was a pattern we developed in recent times. But some people are aware of these things and stay away from these things and Now they are in a higher position in their respective fields. 
                    So what were we doing? We were just following one kind of pattern which was developed by someone else who doesn't exist right now. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <h2>Why do we follow those patterns in our life?
                    </h2>
                    <p>As I said we were following some kind of rules in our daily life. Starting right from our schooling to going to the job right now. Some people won't follow this kind of rules and patterns which were created by a human so they were at the top of their respective field.From a young age, we were triggered to follow these kinds of restrictions  by our parents, priests, teachers, and the list goes on.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to get rid of this kind of curtailment? </h2>

                 <p>As simple as that, we should not follow these rules. That's it.When you have enough knowledge about this world then you'll come to know that these patterns were counterfeit. The more you learn the better you'll become. When I was studying at school my teacher used to say ''we don't need to study after higher studies just we need to Go to college where no one will come to us and say study'' so I thought once our school days are done then we don't need to study anymore. But learning doesn't work like this. We need to learn until we die. Learning plays a huge role in the human life cycle.

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
